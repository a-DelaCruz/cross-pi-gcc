# cross-pi-gcc
Build a Cross-Toolchain for Raspberry Pi 3 from source

Because  this is from a project that i failed to submit on time... I decided to take it as a personal goal to make this work.

As a result of ~2-months research, trials and errors along the way... I finally been able to achieve what i need for my use case
 and now i'' share with everyone that may or may not be useful for you.
 
This is in no-way near to what a Linaro-Toolchain could do, but enough for my needs which are:
  1. A latest C/C++ cross-compiler for armhf Raspberry Pi 3.
  2. This must be able to be use as an alternative compiler for QT for Raspberry Pi. Linaro-7.4.1 which i use to previous projects.
    (also used the raspberrypi tools).

Future support/capability plans:
  1. Arm64
  2. Golang
